Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. 
Therefore, in Example 2 above, the input represents the signed integer -3 and the output represents the signed integer -1073741825.

SOLUTIONS 
public class Solution {

    public int reverseBits(int n) {
        return Integer.reverse(n);
    }
}
